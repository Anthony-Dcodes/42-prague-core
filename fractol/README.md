# Fractol

## Description
Fractol is a graphical program that generates and visualizes fractals, such as the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. The goal of the project is to deepen understanding of complex numbers and graphical rendering using C and the MinilibX library. Users can explore fractals interactively, zooming in and out and observing the intricate patterns they create.

## Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd fractol

2. **Compile project:**
   ```bash
   make

3. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   ./fractol m
   ./fractol j <real> <imag>
   Hint: Julia values in range [-1.5, 1.5] look best.

4. **Controls**
   ```bash
   Use scroll wheel to zoom in/out
   Press ESC or window cross to close program
